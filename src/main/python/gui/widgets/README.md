widgets
=======

This package contains a few widgets used in the demo UI to provide
buttons for user input. The code demonstrates one approach for drawing
buttons that provide visual feedback, and how to effectively interpret
mouse events from Pygame.

Your team can reuse, modify, or discard these examples as you see fit.
