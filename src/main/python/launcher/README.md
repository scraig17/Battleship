launcher
========

This launcher utility will take a set of user IDs representing players,
and it will find or create user objects in the API server for each player,
and then will create a new game object in the API server for a game that
includes the specified players.

After setting up the users and game object, it will then launch the GUI
for each player. When launching the GUI, it will provide the user ID and
password for the player, and the URL for the game.

Your team may reuse this launcher and your team is free to modify it in any
way that makes sense for your project.
